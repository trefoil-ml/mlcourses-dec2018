## Aims of this lesson

* Understand what are decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting, how they works, and how to evaluate a DT or a RF model.

* Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) mostly used in classification problems.

* It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables.

* In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter$/$differentiator in input variables.
